This project aims to analyse tweets in regards to both positive and negative words. Hence we can obtain an understanding as to the general mood/attitude at the time these tweets were published towards Obama. In recent years, it has become neccessairy for politicians to acknowledge and understand the public through social media platforms such as Twitter. 

The positive word file and negative word file have been taken and preprocessed from the Wislon et al. lists, which is a combination of both. 

Please note, the analysis of tweets is still under construction.
